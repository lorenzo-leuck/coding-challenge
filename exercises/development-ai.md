# Write a function that sends a prompt to OpenAI API and logs the response.

# Create a fake image validator function that returns match_score and explanation.

# Design a schema for a validation result using MongoDB.

# Simulate an agent pipeline: warm-up → scrape → validate → store.

# Create a status tracker that logs each phase of the agent's execution.

# Decide which AI model to use for image–text similarity and justify the choice.

# Simulate scraping Pinterest with Playwright or Puppeteer (pseudo-code).

# Implement retries and exponential backoff for failed agent steps.

# Build a system that queues agent tasks for execution (e.g. asyncio or Celery).

# Create an endpoint to re-validate all pins from a previous prompt.

# Implement real-time feedback (WebSocket or long polling) for agent progress.

# Design a way to parallelize validation of multiple images.

# Discuss how you would add a fine-tuned image classifier to replace OpenAI.
