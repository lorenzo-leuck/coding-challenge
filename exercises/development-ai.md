46. Write a function that sends a prompt to OpenAI API and logs the response.
47. Create a fake image validator function that returns match_score and explanation.
48. Design a schema for a validation result using MongoDB.
49. Simulate an agent pipeline: warm-up → scrape → validate → store.
50. Create a status tracker that logs each phase of the agent's execution.
51. Decide which AI model to use for image–text similarity and justify the choice.
52. Simulate scraping Pinterest with Playwright or Puppeteer (pseudo-code).
53. Implement retries and exponential backoff for failed agent steps.
54. Build a system that queues agent tasks for execution (e.g. asyncio or Celery).
55. Create an endpoint to re-validate all pins from a previous prompt.
56. Implement real-time feedback (WebSocket or long polling) for agent progress.
57. Design a way to parallelize validation of multiple images.
58. Discuss how you would add a fine-tuned image classifier to replace OpenAI.
