2. Write pseudocode that takes three numbers and outputs them in ascending order using only comparisons and swaps.

```py
# Fixed 3-number sort
def sortThree(a, b, c):
    if a > b:
        temp = a
        a = b
        b = temp
    if b > c:
        temp = b
        b = c
        c = temp
    if a > b:
        temp = a
        a = b
        b = temp
    return [a, b, c]

# General bubble sort for n numbers
def sortNumbers(n):
    numbers = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:
                temp = numbers[j]
                numbers[j] = numbers[j+1]
                numbers[j+1] = temp
    return numbers

sortThree(3, 1, 2)
sortNumbers(3)
```
