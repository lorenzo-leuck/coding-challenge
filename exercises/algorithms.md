1. Given `a = x / 2` and `b = x / 3`, express `x` in terms of `a` and `b`.

2. If `p = x/4` and `q = x/5` and `p + q = 18`, find the value of `x`.

3. Write pseudocode that takes three numbers and outputs them in ascending order using only comparisons and swaps.

4. Explain step-by-step how to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

5. Write pseudocode that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

6. Given two arrays of integers, write pseudocode that returns a new array with only the elements found in both arrays.

7. Write pseudocode to find the largest and smallest number in an array in one pass.

8. Show two methods to swap `x` and `y` without using a temporary variable: arithmetic and bitwise XOR.

9. Consider this pseudocode:
```
for i = 1 to n:
    for j = 1 to i:
        do O(1) work
```
